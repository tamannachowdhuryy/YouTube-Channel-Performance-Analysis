# YouTube-Channel-Performance-Analysis

This project analyzes the performance of YouTube videos based on various metrics, such as views, watch time, revenue, subscriber growth, and audience engagement. The goal is to uncover trends and actionable insights that help optimize content strategies for YouTube creators.

## Project Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of YouTube video performance, focusing on metrics such as:

- Views and Revenue: Understanding the correlation between views and estimated revenue.
- Watch Time and Subscribers: Exploring how watch time impacts subscriber growth.
- Day of the Week Performance: Identifying the best days to publish videos for maximum engagement and revenue.
- Audience Engagement: Visualizing metrics like likes, dislikes, comments, shares, and subscriber activity.

Key insights include:

1. Higher views lead to higher revenue.
2. Longer watch times result in higher subscriber growth.
3. Thursdays tend to perform best in terms of average revenue generated.
4. Detailed clustering reveals high and low-performing video groups based on key metrics.


## Features and Visualizations
